Vim training class notes
===========

Class notes from the Vim classes I taught at BuffaloLab.

Class 1 has no video as it was just showing people how to install Vim.

Class 2 - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nim4_f5QUxA

Class 3 - Video was corrupted, blame linux. The class notes are expert-1.md

Class 4 - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pqipq-UEwQ
